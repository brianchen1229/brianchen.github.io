<h2>Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning for Cryptocurrency</h2>
<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Li-Han Chang, Po-Wei Chen*, Hung-Wen Cheng, Pei-Jie Hsiao</p>

<p>
This paper investigates machine learningâ€“based factor models for cryptocurrency returns and evaluates their predictive power under different market conditions. Among various algorithms, random forests and support vector regression deliver the most consistent performance across quantile portfolios, achieving higher cumulative returns and superior win rates compared with the equal-weighted market portfolio. These findings highlight the role of machine learning as a viable approach to enhance portfolio construction and generate superior performance in cryptocurrency markets.
