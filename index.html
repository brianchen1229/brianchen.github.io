<h2>Empirical Asset Pricing via Machine Learning for Cryptocurrency</h2>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Brian Chen</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We apply machine learning to the empirical asset pricing problem of forecasting
information coefficients (ICs) in the cryptocurrency market. Using a sample of 998
cryptocurrencies from 2018 to 2022, we evaluate linear regression, tree-based models,
boosted regression trees, kernel approaches, nearest neighbors, and deep neural
networks in predicting future IC values and implementing IC-based long–short
strategies across multiple quantile portfolios. Linear regression (OLS) shows weak
predictive power and often produces poor return performance. In contrast, machine
learning models consistently outperform OLS and the market benchmark. Random
forests and support vector regression deliver the most consistent performance across
quantile portfolios, achieving both higher cumulative returns and superior win rates
compared to the equal-weighted market portfolio. These findings highlight the role of
machine learning as a viable approach to enhance portfolio construction and generate
superior performance in cryptocurrency markets.</p>
